While the pool is active (a specified minimum number of pool members are active) BACKUP members are skipped during server selection.

	// To ensure members are not overloaded, connections to a member can be capped by the load balancer. When a member reaches this limit, it is skipped during server selection. If it is not specified, it means that connections are unlimited.
	MaxConcurrentConnections int64 `json:"max_concurrent_connections,omitempty"`

	// If port is specified, all connections will be sent to this port. Only single port is supported. If unset, the same port the client connected to will be used, it could be overrode by default_pool_member_port setting in virtual server. The port should not specified for port range case.

	// Pool member weight is used for WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN balancing algorithm. The weight value would be ignored in other algorithms.
